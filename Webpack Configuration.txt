INITIAL STAGE
=============================

1. Start with a structure of "dist" and "src". Inside the "src" I have an App.js (or something), a favicon for the website, style folder for styles and a main style.css which will import all the other modules.

DayTwo has SRC: js, scss, img, library

2. npm init -y To instantly start our npm without answering the intro questions. The package.json file will help us manage all our dependencies.
	- Here we can npm install lodash and npm install normalize.css

3. To install Webpack, use npm install webpack webpack-cli --save-dev
After, we need to create our configuration file: webpack.config.js

We also need to write some initial code to our config file. 

4. We need to do some initial basic setup now. First, we create the path: const path = require("path");
Then we create the initial module.exports = {} 
module.exports = {
	entry: {
        main: path.resolve(__dirname, 'src/scripts/main.js')
    },
    output: {
        filename: 'bundled.js', -- we can say [name].bundled.js if we want to here and it will use the entry name
        path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist') -- we can change this to src if we don't want to send the file to a new folder.
    },
	mode: "development", //production
}

And lastly we can make a webpack script to test it. 
    "dev": "webpack-dev-server",
    "build": "webpack",
