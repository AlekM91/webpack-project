INITIAL STAGE
=============================

1. Start with a structure of "dist" and "src". Inside the "src" I have an App.js (or something), a favicon for the website, style folder for styles and a main style.css which will import all the other modules.

DayTwo has SRC: js, scss, img, library

2. npm init -y To instantly start our npm without answering the intro questions. The package.json file will help us manage all our dependencies.
	- Here we can npm install lodash and npm install normalize.css

3. To install Webpack, use npm install webpack webpack-cli --save-dev
After, we need to create our configuration file: webpack.config.js

We also need to write some initial code to our config file. 

4. We need to do some initial basic setup now. First, we create the path: const path = require("path");
Then we create the initial module.exports = {} 
module.exports = {
	entry: {
        main: path.resolve(__dirname, 'src/scripts/main.js')
    },
    output: {
        filename: 'bundled.js', -- we can say [name].bundled.js if we want to here and it will use the entry name
        path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist') -- we can change this to src if we don't want to send the file to a new folder.
    },
	mode: "development", //production
}

And lastly we can make a webpack script to test it. 
    "dev": "webpack-dev-server",
    "build": "webpack",

CSS 
=====

1. Let's add basic CSS support to Webpack
npm install css-loader style-loader --save-dev

2. Import the style into your main JS file
import "../styles/styles.css";

3. A new addition to 
module.exports = {
     module: {
        rules: [
            {
                test: /\.css$/,
                use: ['style-loader', 'css-loader']
            } -- this tests for .css files and uses css-loader and style-loader for our CSS
        ]
    }
}

SCSS
=========

1. Let's add SCSS now to our Webpack
npm install sass sass-loader

2. We change the test name from .css to .scss, rename our styles.css to styles.scss, update the import in our main JS file and add a new loader to our webpack config.
module: {
    rules: [
        {
            test: /\.scss$/,
            use: ['style-loader', 'css-loader', 'sass-loader']
        }
    ]
}
